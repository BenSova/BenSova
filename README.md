<h2 align=center> Hi, I'm BenSova </h2>

I'm a SwiftUI developer trying to make you get the most use (and you) out of your Apple Devices.

Currently I'm working on an app that allows you to run macOS Big Sur on your unsupported Mac. This works best on 2012 ans 2013 Macs to prolong the lifetime of your Mac. It's called **Patched Sur** and you can learn more about it [here](https://github.com/BenSova/Patched-Sur).

Right now **Patched Sur** still needs a lot of refinements and features, but it's a great start for what I have right now, and I'm sure it will become even better in the future.

<h3 align=center> How Active Am I </h3>

Most of my work is done on the weekends in my free time, but I work on the weekdays sometimes too. If I don't respond to your issue, it's ussualy because I'm busy right then or I'm enjoying a little bit of actual free time. I will try to keep up everywhere I can, though, even if I don't respond right away.

<h3 align=center> Patched Sur Roadmap </h3>

1. Add **clean install** functionality to the pre install app.
2. **Rewrite Patch Kexts** to better fit the UI scheme.
3. **A WHOLE LOT OF POLISHING**

<h3 align=center> What do I daily drive? </h3>

It would be crazy for me, the developer of a patcher, not to be using an unsupported Mac as my daily driver. So, I do! I use a Mid-2012 MacBook Pro for all of my laptop needs, like working in Xcode or Final Cut Pro. Suprisingly, Big Sur really does run great on that Mac (Apple should of supported it, even with the WiFi and CPU discontinuations)! Technically this is both my primary Mac and my testing Mac, so I might need to be a little bit more careful, but who really does that? Did I forget to mention that the thing thinks it is a 16" 2019 MacBook Pro?

My iPhone is of course another old device, a simple iPhone 6s, that's running iOS 14.2 (I know right, not the beta). However, once again, there's a twist, my phone is jailbroken with Unc0ver. Who would have thought, a jailbroken phone and a patched Mac? *And of course I have another old device*, my Apple Watch Series 0! (Wait, can I jailbreak that thing too?)
